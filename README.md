# Terrorism Analysis Project

## Overview

During my internship at The Sparks Foundation, I had the opportunity to work on a Terrorism Analysis project. The objective was to analyze and visualize terrorism-related data to derive meaningful insights. The analysis was conducted using Python for data cleaning and Power BI for creating interactive visualizations.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed columns with more than 80% missing data.
   - Filled null values in the remaining columns with appropriate values.

2. **Data Analysis in Power BI:**
   - Loaded the cleaned data into Power BI for further analysis.
   - Addressed various questions related to terrorism trends, targeting patterns, attack methods, and more.

## Questions Explored

The analysis aimed to answer questions such as:
- Most targeted region.
- Popular targets of terrorists.
- Total suicide attacks.
- Most used weapon types.
- Most attacked countries.
- Total terror groups.
- Yearly analysis of terrorism incidents.
- Top 10 countries and cities with the most terror attacks.
- Popular terror groups in hot zones.
- Countries-wise suicide attack incidents.
- Top attack methods in high incident areas.

## Visualization and Reporting

Visualizations and insights were presented through interactive dashboards in Power BI. The report covers a wide range of aspects related to global terrorism, providing a comprehensive view of trends and patterns over the years.
